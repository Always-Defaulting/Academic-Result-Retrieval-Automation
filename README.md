# Academic-Result-Retrieval-Automation

This project implements an end-to-end Python automation pipeline to consolidate academic result data from a form-based web system into structured Excel outputs.

## Problem Statement
Manual retrieval and consolidation of individual academic results is time-consuming and error-prone when performed at scale.

## Solution Overview
The automation extracts structured identifiers from ID cards using OCR, prepares validated input datasets, submits form-based queries programmatically, and parses returned HTML responses to generate subject-wise grades along with TGPA and CGPA.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Requests
- BeautifulSoup
- Pandas
- OpenPyXL
- Tesseract OCR

## Workflow
1. OCR-based parsing of ID card images
2. Structured CSV generation for input validation
3. Programmatic form submission using HTTP requests
4. HTML response parsing for subject-wise grades
5. Consolidated Excel output generation
